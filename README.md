2) NGF_d2.m

generates a Network Geometry with Flavor of dimension 2

3) NGF_d3.m

generates a Network Geometry with Flavor of dimension 3

4) NGF_d4.m

generates a Network Geometry with Flavor of dimension 4

5) NGF_d_simplex

 generates a  d-dimensional Network Geometry with Flavor built by d-dimensional simplices.
